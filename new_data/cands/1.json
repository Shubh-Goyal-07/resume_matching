    "description": "The project is titled 'LLMGuard'. \n\nThis project developed a pipeline for detecting bias and toxicity in the output of large language models, such as GPT-2 and BERT, and created a user-friendly UI and backend using ReactJS and Django Rest Framework to facilitate the integration of detectors. Skills used includes ReactJS, Django, Python, JavaScript. The project uses ReactJS, Django, Python, JavaScript. The project is titled 'Literature Society IITJ Website'. \n\nThis project is a website for the Literature Society of IIT Jodhpur, featuring user profile management, library management system, a reader's section to upload written works, and moderator and admin access profiles for approval of content. Skills used includes ReactJS, Django, Python, JavaScript. The project uses ReactJS, Django, Python, JavaScript. The project is titled 'CloudPhysician's Vital Extraction Challenge'. \n\nThis project fine-tuned DETR and detectron for ICU monitor segmentation images and vital segmentation from ICU monitors. Additionally, it included a graph digitisation algorithm to digitize ECG strips. Skills used includes Computer Vision, Image Processing. The project uses Computer Vision, Image Processing. The project is titled 'Multi Model Data Analysis for Annotation of Human Activities'. \n\nThis project involved data analysis and outlier detection on sensor readings from accelerometers and gyroscopes to detect human activities. A pipeline was created to clean the data and accurately detect the activity type. Skills used includes Data Analysis, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Sklearn, Python.
