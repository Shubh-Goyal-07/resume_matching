    "description": "The project is titled 'Cloudphysician's Vital Extraction Challenge'. \n\nThis project uses object detection and text recognition to extract values of vitals from images of ICU monitors and returns the values in a Python dictionary. The extracted values enable real-time monitoring of patient health in the ICU. Skills used includes Computer Vision, Image Processing. The project uses Computer Vision, Image Processing. The project is titled 'Multi Model Data Analysis for Annotation of Human Activities'. \n\nThis project aims to build a pipeline that can accurately predict human activities by continuous analysis of data from accelerometer and gyroscope present in a smartwatch. It will use multiple models to analyze the data and annotate the activities. Skills used includes Python, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Sklearn. The project uses Python, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Sklearn. The project is titled 'Website for the Literature Society of the college'. \n\nThis project is a website for the Literature Society of the college, focusing on a library management system and a readers' section where users can view and upload content. It also includes additional features to enhance the user experience. Skills used includes Django Rest Framework, ReactJS. The project uses Django Rest Framework, ReactJS. The project is titled 'Post-processing of Large Language Models'. \n\nThis project focused on developing the backend of a user interface for machine learning models to detect hate profanity, bias etc in the responses generated by large language models, integrating the models with the user interface using Rest APIs. Skills used includes Pytorch, Tensorflow, Keras, Django Rest Framework, ReactJS. The project uses Pytorch, Tensorflow, Keras, Django Rest Framework, ReactJS. ",
