    "description": "The project is titled 'Cloudphysician's Vital Extraction Challenge'. \n\nThis project implements object detection and text recognition to extract vital values from ICU monitor images and returns them in a python dictionary. The extracted values are used to monitor the patient's health in real-time. Skills used includes Computer Vision, Image Processing. The project uses Computer Vision, Image Processing. The project is titled 'Multi Model Data Analysis for Annotation of Human Activities'. \n\nThis project is focused on building a data pipeline to accurately identify human activities from data acquired from accelerometers and gyroscopes in a smartwatch. The data analysis will involve multi-model approaches to accurately annotate the activities. Skills used includes Python, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Sklearn. The project uses Python, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Sklearn. The project is titled 'Website for the Literature Society of the college'. \n\nThis project aims to create a website for the Literature Society of the college with a library management system and a readers' section, allowing users to view, upload and share content. Skills used includes Django Rest Framework, ReactJS. The project uses Django Rest Framework, ReactJS. The project is titled 'Post-processing of Large Language Models'. \n\nThis project aimed to develop a user interface with an integrated machine learning model to detect hate profanity, bias, and other offensive language in responses generated by large language models. The backend of the system was developed using Rest APIs to connect the machine learning model with the user interface. Skills used includes Pytorch, Tensorflow, Keras, Django Rest Framework, ReactJS. The project uses Pytorch, Tensorflow, Keras, Django Rest Framework, ReactJS. ",
