    "description": "The project is titled 'Cloudphysician's Vital Extraction Challenge'. \n\nThis project uses object detection and text recognition to extract the values of vitals from ICU monitors and return them as a python dictionary. The extracted values can then be used for further analysis and diagnosis. Skills used includes Computer Vision, Image Processing. The project uses Computer Vision, Image Processing. The project is titled 'Multi Model Data Analysis for Annotation of Human Activities'. \n\nThis project focuses on the development of a multi-modal data analysis pipeline for the annotation of human activities. The pipeline utilizes data from a smartwatch accelerometer and gyroscope to accurately predict human activities. Skills used includes Python, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Sklearn. The project uses Python, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Sklearn. The project is titled 'Website for the Literature Society of the college'. \n\nThis project aims to create a website for the Literature Society of the college, which will comprise of a library management system and a readers' section where users can view and upload content. It will also contain other features to facilitate efficient management of the library. Skills used includes Django Rest Framework, ReactJS. The project uses Django Rest Framework, ReactJS. The project is titled 'Post-processing of Large Language Models'. \n\nThis project aimed to develop a user interface for machine learning models to detect hate profanity, bias, etc. in large language models. I was involved in integrating the machine learning models with the user interface using Rest APIs to create the backend of the system. Skills used includes Pytorch, Tensorflow, Keras, Django Rest Framework, ReactJS. The project uses Pytorch, Tensorflow, Keras, Django Rest Framework, ReactJS. "
