    "description": "The project is titled 'Cloudphysician's Vital Extraction Challenge'. \n\nThe Cloudphysician's Vital Extraction Challenge involves extracting vital values from images of ICU monitors using object detection and text recognition techniques. The project aims to return the extracted values in the form of a python dictionary. Skills used includes Computer Vision, Image Processing. The project uses Computer Vision, Image Processing. The project is titled 'Multi Model Data Analysis for Annotation of Human Activities'. \n\nThis project aims to accurately predict human activities using data from a smartwatch's accelerometer and gyroscope. A multi-model data analysis pipeline will be implemented to continuously analyze the data and provide annotations for the recorded activities. Skills used includes Python, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Sklearn. The project uses Python, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Sklearn. The project is titled 'Website for the Literature Society of the college'. \n\nThis project is a website for the Literature Society of a college, featuring a library management system and a readers' section where users can view and upload content. It also includes other features.  Skills used includes Django Rest Framework, ReactJS. The project uses Django Rest Framework, ReactJS. The project is titled 'Post-processing of Large Language Models'. \n\nWe developed a user interface for detecting hate speech, profanity, and bias in responses generated by large language models. My role was integrating the machine learning models with the user interface using Rest APIs. Skills used includes Pytorch, Tensorflow, Keras, Django Rest Framework, ReactJS. The project uses Pytorch, Tensorflow, Keras, Django Rest Framework, ReactJS. ",
