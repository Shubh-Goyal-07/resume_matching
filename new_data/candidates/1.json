        "LLMGuard": "\n\nThis project developed an automated pipeline for bias/toxicity detection in outputs of large language models such as GPT-2, BERT, and others. It also included a user-friendly UI built with ReactJS and a backend built with Django Rest Framework for easy integration of detectors. Skills used includes ReactJS, Django, Python, JavaScript.. The project uses ReactJS, Django, Python, JavaScript.",
        "Literature Society IITJ Website": "\n\nThis project aims to develop a website for the Literature Society of IIT Jodhpur to manage library resources, user profiles, notifications, and uploads of written works. It includes profiles for moderators and admins to approve books and content. Skills used includes ReactJS, Django, Python, JavaScript.. The project uses ReactJS, Django, Python, JavaScript.",
        "CloudPhysician's Vital Extraction Challenge": "\n\nThis project used fine-tuned DETR and Detectron models to segment images of ICU rooms and vital signs from ICU monitors. Additionally, a graph digitization algorithm was used to digitize ECG strips. Skills used includes Computer Vision, Image Processing.. The project uses Computer Vision, Image Processing.",
        "Multi Model Data Analysis for Annotation of Human Activities": "\n\nThis project involved data analysis and outlier detection on a dataset of accelerometer and gyroscope readings, with an end goal of detecting and annotating the type of human activity. A pipeline was designed and executed for data cleaning and activity type detection. Skills used includes Data Analysis, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Sklearn, Python.. The project uses Data Analysis, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Sklearn, Python.",
        "FaceNet Implementation": "\n\nThis project implemented the FaceNet research paper and a Standard Siamese Network, both from scratch using PyTorch, and trained them on the CelebA dataset. The project was successful in training both networks. Skills used includes PyTorch, Python.. The project uses PyTorch, Python."
