        "LLMGuard": "\n\nThis project developed a pipeline for detecting bias and toxicity in the output of large language models, such as GPT-2 and BERT. It also integrated a user-friendly UI (ReactJS) and backend (Django Rest Framework) for easy integration of detectors and providing an intuitive platform for using the pipeline. Skills used includes ReactJS, Django, Python, JavaScript.. The project uses ReactJS, Django, Python, JavaScript.",
        "Literature Society IITJ Website": "\n\nThis project is a website for the Literature Society of IIT Jodhpur. It includes features such as user profile management, library management system, content upload for reader's section, and moderator/admin access profiles for approving books and contents. Skills used includes ReactJS, Django, Python, JavaScript.. The project uses ReactJS, Django, Python, JavaScript.",
        "CloudPhysician's Vital Extraction Challenge": "\n\nThis project used fine-tuned DETR and detectron to segment images of ICU rooms and vitals from ICU monitors. Additionally, a graph digitisation algorithm was implemented to digitize ECG strips. Skills used includes Computer Vision, Image Processing.. The project uses Computer Vision, Image Processing.",
        "Multi Model Data Analysis for Annotation of Human Activities": "\n\nThis project involved performing data analysis and outlier detection on a dataset of accelerometer and gyroscope readings to identify human activity types. The project included a pipeline for cleaning the data and detecting the activity type. Skills used includes Data Analysis, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Sklearn, Python.. The project uses Data Analysis, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Sklearn, Python.",
        "FaceNet Implementation": "\n\nThis project implemented the FaceNet research paper and a Standard Siamese network from scratch using PyTorch, and trained both on the CelebA dataset. The implementation was successful, and both models achieved good performance. Skills used includes PyTorch, Python.. The project uses PyTorch, Python."
