        "LLMGuard": "\n\nThis project developed a pipeline for detecting bias and toxicity in outputs of large language models such as GPT-2 and BERT. It also integrated a user-friendly UI and backend to provide an intuitive platform to use the developed pipeline. Skills used includes ReactJS, Django, Python, JavaScript.. The project uses ReactJS, Django, Python, JavaScript.",
        "Literature Society IITJ Website": "\n\nThis project is the development of a website for the Literature Society of IIT Jodhpur, which provides user profile management, library management system, and a reader's section to view and upload written works. It also provides moderator and admin access profiles to approve books and contents. Skills used includes ReactJS, Django, Python, JavaScript.. The project uses ReactJS, Django, Python, JavaScript.",
        "CloudPhysician's Vital Extraction Challenge": "\n\nThis project uses DETR and Detectron fine-tuning to segment ICU monitor images and extract vital data from them. Additionally, an ECG strip digitisation algorithm is developed to convert ECG readings to digital format. Skills used includes Computer Vision, Image Processing.. The project uses Computer Vision, Image Processing.",
        "Multi Model Data Analysis for Annotation of Human Activities": "\n\nThis project used data analysis and outlier detection on accelerometer and gyroscope readings to create a pipeline for cleaning data and detecting human activities. The pipeline was used to accurately annotate the activity types in the dataset. Skills used includes Data Analysis, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Sklearn, Python.. The project uses Data Analysis, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Sklearn, Python.",
        "FaceNet Implementation": "\n\nThis project implemented the FaceNet research paper and a Standard Siamese network from scratch using PyTorch and trained them on the CelebA dataset. The successful implementation of this project demonstrated the effectiveness of the FaceNet architecture. Skills used includes PyTorch, Python.. The project uses PyTorch, Python."
