        "Cloudphysician's Vital Extraction Challenge": "\n\nThis project used object detection and text recognition to extract values of vitals from ICU monitor images and return them as a python dictionary. The goal was to accurately recognize and extract the vitals from the images. Skills used includes Computer Vision, Image Processing.. The project uses Computer Vision, Image Processing.",
        "Multi Model Data Analysis for Annotation of Human Activities": "\n\nThis project is focused on leveraging multi-model data analysis to accurately predict human activities using accelerometer and gyroscope data from a smartwatch. The pipeline will provide continuous analysis and annotation of activities in order to improve accuracy. Skills used includes Python, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Sklearn.. The project uses Python, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Sklearn.",
        "Website for the Literature Society of the college": "\n\nThis project will create a website for the Literature Society of the college. It will feature a library management system and a readers' section with options to upload and view content. Skills used includes Django Rest Framework, ReactJS.. The project uses Django Rest Framework, ReactJS.",
        "Post-processing of Large Language Models": "\n\nThis project focused on creating a user interface for machine learning models trained to detect hate profanity, bias and other offensive language in responses generated by large language models. The backend of the system was developed by integrating these models with the user interface using Rest APIs. Skills used includes Pytorch, Tensorflow, Keras, Django Rest Framework, ReactJS.. The project uses Pytorch, Tensorflow, Keras, Django Rest Framework, ReactJS."
