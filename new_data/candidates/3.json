        "Cloudphysician's Vital Extraction Challenge": "\n\nThis project developed an automated system to extract vital values from ICU monitor images using object detection and text recognition techniques. The extracted values were returned in the form of a Python dictionary. Skills used includes Computer Vision, Image Processing.. The project uses Computer Vision, Image Processing.",
        "Multi Model Data Analysis for Annotation of Human Activities": "\n\nThis project aims to develop an automated pipeline that uses a combination of accelerometer and gyroscope data to accurately predict human activities. The pipeline will use multi-model data analysis techniques to analyze the data and generate annotations for each activity. Skills used includes Python, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Sklearn.. The project uses Python, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Sklearn.",
        "Website for the Literature Society of the college": "\n\nThis project focuses on creating a website for the Literature Society of the college with features such as library management system and readers' section for users to view and upload content. It will also include other features to manage content and provide a pleasant user experience. Skills used includes Django Rest Framework, ReactJS.. The project uses Django Rest Framework, ReactJS.",
        "Post-processing of Large Language Models": "\n\nThis project involved building a user interface for machine learning models to detect hate profanity, bias, etc. in the responses generated by large language models. The backend was developed by integrating the machine learning models with the user interface using Rest APIs. Skills used includes Pytorch, Tensorflow, Keras, Django Rest Framework, ReactJS.. The project uses Pytorch, Tensorflow, Keras, Django Rest Framework, ReactJS."
