        "Cloudphysician's Vital Extraction Challenge": "\n\nThis project aimed to extract the values of vitals from ICU monitor images using object detection and text recognition, returning the values in a python dictionary. Skills used includes Computer Vision, Image Processing.. The project uses Computer Vision, Image Processing.",
        "Multi Model Data Analysis for Annotation of Human Activities": "\n\nThis project aims to develop a pipeline to accurately annotate human activities using data collected from accelerometer and gyroscope sensors present in a smartwatch. The pipeline will employ multi-model data analysis approaches to determine the activity the user is performing. Skills used includes Python, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Sklearn.. The project uses Python, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Sklearn.",
        "Website for the Literature Society of the college": "\n\nThis project aims to develop a website for the Literature Society of the college. It will have a library management system and a readers' section where users can view and upload content. Skills used includes Django Rest Framework, ReactJS.. The project uses Django Rest Framework, ReactJS.",
        "Post-processing of Large Language Models": "\n\nThis project developed a user interface that integrated a machine learning model to detect hate profanity, bias, etc in the responses generated by large language models via Rest APIs. The backend was developed to enable the integration of the machine learning models with the user interface. Skills used includes Pytorch, Tensorflow, Keras, Django Rest Framework, ReactJS.. The project uses Pytorch, Tensorflow, Keras, Django Rest Framework, ReactJS."
